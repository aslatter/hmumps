LineAST:
	run the Main executable, and try to enter valid comands.
	fix what doesn't work :)

	Change
	> data Name = Name String
	to 
	> type Name = String
	(along with everything that uses the constructor)

	entering
	> h:cond
	seems to be broken

	> g label+12^place
	parses as expected, however theres a problem of left-facotrin
	the arguments to a GOTO (and likely a DO):
	a GotoArg as a whole is allowed to be indirect:
	> g @arg1,@arg2
	and a Label is allowed to be indirect:
	> g @lanel^routine
	should work.  currently, the '@' is seen as an
	indication that the whole GotoArg is indirect, when
	in fact it's just the label.
