LineAST:
	run the Main executable, and try to enter valid comands.
	fix what doesn't work :)

	Change
	> data Name = Name String
	to 
	> type Name = String
	(along with everything that uses the constructor)

	parseLocation doesn't work proper.
	into Main, entering
	> g somewhere
	the text "somewhere" will be interpreted as the name of
	a routine, when it should be the name of a label.

	entering
	> h:cond
	seems to be broken
