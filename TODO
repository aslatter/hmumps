LineAST:
	replace the "Location" datastructure with an
	"EntryRef" datastructure, which subsumes the
	MUMPS "entryref" and "labelref"

	run the Main executable, and try to enter valid comands.
	fix was doesn't work :)

	Change
	> data Name = Name String
	to 
	> type Name = String
	(along with everything that uses the constructor)
